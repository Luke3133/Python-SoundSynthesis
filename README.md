# SoundSynthesis

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional digital synthesizer in Python. I don't intend to make this a standalone vst instrument but I will likely add some midi functionality at some point. 

I will publish various iterations along the way, starting with basic versions to demonstrate the techniques I used. The more advanced versions may be considered complicated to a beginner programmer but you might be able to understand what is happening by working through each version and reading the comments.
